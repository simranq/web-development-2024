Scoping means that it can be used in certain places.
ex - we can't use a module unless we use module.exports = {..} //in node only

Block specific scoping- specified within curly braces ({})
-------
Synchronous means : This operation must be completed before following operations(code) can be 
started & executed. It’s like a single-lane road where only one car can pass at a time. Everything happens in 
order, which can make things predictable but sometimes slow, especially if one task takes a long time.

Asynchronous means : Opns can be executed simultaneously with other opns. 
It doesn't block the execution of following code.In programming, "asynchronous" means that tasks can be executed independently of each other.
This allows multiple tasks to run concurrently without waiting for each other to complete. It’s like a multi-lane highway where cars can overtake each other, making it much more efficient for handling
multiple tasks at once.

In JAVASCRIPT, we've a built-in stadardized objects called 'PROMISES' that can wrap async operations.

# async and await are syntax sugar built on top of Promises, making asynchronous code easier to write and read.

#1 async is a keyword you place before a function to make it return a Promise. Any function you define with async will implicitly return a Promise. If it returns a value, that value is wrapped in a resolved Promise.
#2 await is used inside an async function to pause execution until a Promise is resolved. It makes your asynchronous code look synchronous, making it easier to read and understand.
