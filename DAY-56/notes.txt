- WHAT & WHY ?
- SQL vs NoSQL DATABASES
NEED - stored data in afile abhi tak read & fetch data from a file, but it is not great
create data->replace entire content in file with new content
read data   -> always read entire file
update data -> read entire data, find content to update, replace entire content.
delete data -> read entire content, find content to pdate, replace entire content
                ----pretty inefficient, scalability issue, cconcurrency issue----
CRUD operations
Databases systems to the rescue!

2 TYPES OF DATABASES - RDBMS / SQL Databases, Non RDBMS / NoSQL Databases
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SQL DATABASES
Store normalized data across multiple tables.
Clearly defined schemas and datatypes.
--------------------------
NoSQL DATABASES
Store data in JSON format (objects, docs not rows and columns)
data redundancy
Store more info in few tables and fetch more info using fewer queries
--------------------------
Which one should one choose ?
points - no. of queries, how often read/write, data storing
