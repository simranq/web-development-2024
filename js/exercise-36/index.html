        <h2>Why JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is a programming language which can be executed by the browser, after the page was loaded. </p>
        <p>With JavaScript, you, as a developer, can access, read and manipulate the parsed HTML code ("the DOM") to add additional behavior and features to the page.</p>
        <p>For example, you can make the below button remove this text!</p>
        <button>Remove Paragraph</button>
        <p>or click the next button to change the background color to blue</p>
        <button id = "add_bg_color">Add Blue Background Color</button>
