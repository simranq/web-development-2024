Let's plan our database structure !

Collections (Posts, Authors):-

Posts - id, title, summary, body, author_id & name -> authors.id, date
Authors - id, name, email  //#(pre-populated)# 

Note that the project is same, but we are implementing it using MongoDB (NoSQL) database.


const client = await MongoClient.connect('mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017');
We are going to use a 3rd party package so that we dont havta manage the connection by ourself - 
'MongoDB Node Driver'. Connect MongoDB from inside NodeJS
terminal-> 'npm install mongodb@6.10'
