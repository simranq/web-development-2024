# DAY 51 #
One more use -
in all our html (ejs files) we've that shared header tag same in every file with customized a link's href adjustments. it means that code needs a lot of adjustments.
now, ejs has a feature called 'includes' that helps us deal with that prblm.
It is an ejs file to split ur big html file into smaller, more manageable pieces.


WHAT DID WE DO ON DAY 51?

added includes folder in views folder
In 'includes' folder we created a 'header.ejs' file copy the header here.
<%- content %> =>   '-' is another ejs syntax we use when we wanna render some HTML content.
cuz, by default, if we o/p smthg in this ejs form, it o/ps as raw text i.e user can't inject html text (like imgs) thus top-notch security!!
<%= content %> => '=' sign escapes the value that it o/ps i.e. translates it into raw text. Useful for user-generated content and not for including some HTML code.
<%- %>         => '-' doesn't escape but will actually treat HTML code as HTML code instead of raw text.
<%- include %> =>  allows us to specify a path to another file & then that file would be parsed by ejs as well and it will generate that html content and inject nd treat it as html content. By default, u can use relative path.
can pass dynamic data too.

<%- include('includes/header', {}) %> => 'path', object with data in {}
                                      => just like render()

TO REDUCE CODE REDUNDANCY (OF HEADER & SIDE-DRAWER), WE'VE CREATED SEPARATE FILES WITHIN INCLUDES FOLDER  
<%- include('includes/header') %>
<%- include('includes/side-drawer') %>
BY WRITING THE ABOVE 2 LINES OF CODE, WE CAN REDUCE CODE REPETITION OF THE HEADER & ASIDE TAGS.
Code can be easily maintained.
we did the same thing with the <head> by => '<%- include('includes/head') %>'
Note that, restaurant-item.ejs has dynamic data but include accepts dynamic data too even though'-' is there. but add object {} too. here restaurant key
1 prblm is that ejs language isn't understood by VS Code, which can be done by installing 'EJS LANGUAGE SUPPORT'.

WE WERE ABLE TO CHANGE THE HTML CONTENT DYNAMICALLY ON THE SERVER USING EJS. WE NEEDED THIS TEMPLATE ENGINE ONLY CUZ WE HAD SOME DYNAMIC CONTENT!
& HENCE WE NEEDED A SERVER-SIDE LANGUAGE.
BENEFITS-
using include we can divide file into segments
ejs allows us to o/p values <%= gffffnh %> as raw text.
also run js lang too like 'for', 'if-else'
# NOTE   -    ALWAYS KNOW THAT SERVER GETS THE FINISHED  HTML CODE & NOT ALL THE EJS..
static css & js files can be served using express.static (static is a middleware) of a specific folder.
