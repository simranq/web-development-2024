Let's plan our database structure !

Collections (Posts, Authors):-

Posts - id, title, summary, body, author_id & name -> authors.id, date
Authors - id, name, email  //#(pre-populated)# 

Note that the project is same, but we are implementing it using MongoDB (NoSQL) database.
const client = await MongoClient.connect('mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017');

We are going to use a 3rd party package so that we dont havta manage the connection by ourself - 
'MongoDB Node Driver'. Connect MongoDB from inside NodeJS
terminal-> 'npm install mongodb@6.10'

whenever error, defsult error handling nai hota instead id valid nai hota h toh crashh!!
since these functions are async-> they return promise-> thus express is unable to catch the errors and thi is a limitation
and we can use try,catch manually to identify errors.
add a 3rd parameter in async fxn(req,res,next){} -> it moves onto nxt middleware in line
