This is a MILESTONE PROJECT 01
Built with HTML, CSS, JS

STEPS:
1] Configure player names->form with i/p field & modal overlay, also validate user
 i/p & show validation feedback.

2] (Re - )Start Game-> 'Start Game' button should never clear current game board 
or 'Game Over' msg.

3] Turn-based gameplay-> Turns should switch automatically between the 2 players.
Every player has his/her own symbol.

4] Select fields & check for winner-> Game fields are clickable & the player's symbol is 
displayed. Check for winner(regular Tic-Tac-Toe rules) after every turn.

5] show 'Game Over' window-> Present 'Game Over' msg which highlights winner (or draw)
 once the game ends.

        a sidebar for some navigation, overlay.
        alternative is <div>
